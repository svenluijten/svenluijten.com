When you would have asked me about Zara Larsson 3 months ago, the name would have rung a bell, but I couldn't have named
you a single song from her. But I certainly recognized some of her songs! I didn't realize how big she was (and how good
her music was!) until I started diving in in preparation for this show.

So when my girlfriend asked if I wanted to come with her to this show, I was pretty excited! Not only because I got to
share my love for live music with her, but also because Zara Larsson is apparently _really_ good live. And sure enough:
she is!

The opening act was Omar Rudberg, and he was a pretty fun warm-up act. The Venezuelan-born, Swedish-raised singer (whose
birthday it was, by the way!) owned the stage as if he was the main act, and got the crowd very excited for Zara's
performance. He did drop the mic midway through his set which, honestly, was kind of endearing. He picked it up and
continued without missing another beat.

Zara's most recent album is very summer-coated, so despite the dropping temperatures here in The Netherlands midway
through November, we had our own little summer party. Followed by some deep cuts and her most popular songs out of her
back catalogue, she closed the show by bringing two audience members on stage to dance with her and be witness to the
closing track up close. All in all a great performance, and I was pleasantly surprised with how great she sounded live!

I really enjoyed _Pretty Ugly_ during which several audience members were shown without a filter ("pretty"), and with an
"ugly" filter on the big screen, her intimate rendition of _Uncover_, and the poppy _Crush_.
