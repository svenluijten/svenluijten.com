                Of the social media, I'm most active on BlueSky as <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/svenluijten.com" class="link">@svenluijten.com</a>.
            </li>
            <li>
                <a href="https://linkedin.com/in/svenluijten" class="link">My LinkedIn profile</a> is mainly for connecting with (old) coworkers, but if you find value in that platform, shoot me a follow.
            </li>
            <li>
                If you prefer a private chat, <a href="https://signal.me/#eu/JNXmTnN5P0iYxnWn3ylb-txh4uIklmdAHwUjEwonKipJSbLrkmNFT61w0g6LkLUx" class="link">Signal</a> is your best bet.
                I check this about once a week, so don't expect a reply straight away.
            </li>
            <li>
                If you absolutely must send me an email, you can do so to <code class="code">website</code> at this domain. I only look at this inbox about once a week.
