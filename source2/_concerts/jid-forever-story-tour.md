Anticipating a large crowd for this show, I showed up about 3 hours before doors opened. Turns out that wasn't necessary
_at all_, I was the only one there. Walked around the block and had some food, show up again 45 minutes later and 
there's just 3 other people. Security guy setting up the queue came out of the venue and told us to go and enjoy 
ourselves in Amsterdam, if we came back around 6pm he'd bump us to the front of the queue. So when I showed up a bit 
later, security flagged me down and I could be the first in the queue. Hell yeah.

Entering the venue, we joined the people who booked a Meet & Greet directly in front of the stage. I had my records with
me that I placed next to the stage monitors along with the markers. 

The show was _incredible_! I've been waiting for JID to tour Europe for a while now, and finally getting to see him
after nearly missing out on tickets was crazy. The audience, on the other hand, wasn't so great. There was so much
unnecessary pushing, screaming, and grabbing which detracted from the whole experience. 

Either way, JID ended up seeing my records perched on the stage halfway through the show, picked up a marker, and signed
them right then and there.

Standouts from this performance were _Stars_ (for which he sat down off the edge of the stage, right where I was 
standing), _Surround Sound_, _Kody Blu 31_, _Off Deez_, and _Wells Fargo_. Yes, it was hard to pick favorites from this 
show because his set (and discography, to be honest) is absolutely _packed_ with bangers.
