After [seeing Chance 2 years prior](./chance-the-rapper-coloring-book-tour.md), I got introduced to his brother's music.
When I saw that he was doing a European tour sometime later, it was an instant buy for me. When waiting outside we saw 
Taylor come out and ask us where the nearest McDonald's was, which I thought was pretty cool.

There were _maybe_ 50 people tops once the show was about to start. I felt kind of bad for the warmup act and Taylor,
but it turned into a quite intimate show with an artist I liked, so I tried to ignore the kind of pathetic aspect of it 
all.

I even got a photo and a little chat with the DJ and Taylor after the show, so that was nice! The small crowd managed to
turn up the energy during _Minimum Wage_, which really stands out in my mind from the show.
