Ok, sure. _Revival_ was a bad album. But that doesn't discount the fact that I saw Eminem live! Luckily he did plenty of
old songs from his prolific career as a rapper. I found it funny that his emcee (Mr. Porter, or Denaun) kept saying
something to the effect of "What's up Amsterdam!!!" while we were in Nijmegen, nowhere near Amsterdam by Dutch standards.
Thankfully Em corrected him a couple of times.

What a show. Eminem is such a prolific artist that I'm glad I saw him live at least once before his inevitable 
retirement. Standout tracks he did were _Rap God_, _Fast Lane_ together with Royce Da 5'9", and _Forever_. The girl next
to me was surprised to see I knew _all_ the words to _Forever_. I'll take that as a compliment.
