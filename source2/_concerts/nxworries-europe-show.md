This was absolutely my favorite show to date. It felt like the tickets for this were _so hot_, almost everyone that knew
about Anderson .Paak wanted to get their hands on them. Luckily I got them the moment they first went on sale, and man
what a show. NxWorries (a duo consisting of Anderson .Paak and Knxwledge) were playing festivals all over Europe, and
came to little old Utrecht for an exclusive and what felt like very intimite show.

I'd seen Anderson .Paak previously [in Copenhagen](./anderson-paak-oxnard-tour.md), but this show was something else. He
didn't do any of his solo work, but instead focussed solely on NxWorries. _Fan-tas-tic choice_! These songs were _made_
to be performed live.

I absolutely loved this. The long wait at the front of the queue was worth the result; standing all the way up against
the stage seeing these two heroes of mine do what they do best. And I even managed to get some of my vinyl records 
signed by both of them!
