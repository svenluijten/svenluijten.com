I was (of course) _way_ too early for this show yet again, but the opening act ended up being way more fun than I would
have thought beforehand! The little crowd that was already there was also feeling it, and we vibed to Esaro's music for
about half an hour before she left the stage to make way for Sudan Archives. 

This show felt very theatrical, which I'm not super into. Regardless, the performance was still great and I still got to
enjoy the music from super close up to the stage. Her bass-heavy songs definitely hit harder live, and the more slow
and/or violin-heavy tracks were a joy too.

_Freakalizer_, _The BPM_, and _Confessions_ were stand-outs from this show, all executed absolutely flawlessly.
