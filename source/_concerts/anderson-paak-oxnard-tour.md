Sad I missed out on getting tickets for the Amsterdam show, but hellbent on going to see Anderson .Paak live, I had to
get tickets for one of his international shows. Copenhagen in Denmark sounded fun, as I'd never been there and I could 
make it a long weekend. 

Tayla Parx opened, and I'll be honest I don't remember a lot from her performance. But once the main act started, I was
fully tuned in. What a fantastic show! Andy showing off his drumming skills interwoven with his singing and rapping was 
so cool to finally see live. And the show wouldn't be complete without a little tribute to the late Mac Miller at the 
end.
