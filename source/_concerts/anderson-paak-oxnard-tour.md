Sad I missed out on getting tickets for the Amsterdam show, but hellbent on going to see Anderson .Paak live, I had to
get tickets for one of his international shows. Denmark sounded fun, as I'd never been there and I could make it a long
weekend. 

What a fantastic show. Andy showing off his drumming skills interwoven with his singing and rapping was so cool to
finally see live. And the show wouldn't be complete without a little tribute to the late Mac Miller at the end.
