The first opening act for this show was Johan Lenox, and he thoroughly surprised me with how good it sounded! I'll be
checking out his music after this show for sure.

I initially found 070 Shake through her collaborations with Kanye West, and dove into her discography a while back to
see if she had any interesting solo projects. Sure enough, her album _Modus Vivendi_ absolutely blew me away, and while
her most recent project _Petrichor_ had to grow on me, I still liked it enough to go see her live.

The show was great! Her layered vocals just hit a certain spot in my brain that brings me into a trance the second they
come up. I was also really impressed by her ability to strip down some of her songs to just an acoustic guitar and her
unaltered voice; just as pretty as on her albums.

Shake closed off the show with her part of Kanye West's "Ghost Town"; where I originally discovered her through. She
noticed one guy in the crowd singing all the words with so much conviction that she tossed him the mic, and he proceeded
to make this closer a memorable one for everyone.
