I used to listen to Die Antwoord a lot back when their music was still relatively fresh, so 
when I saw their tour announcement I had a wave of nostalgia wash over me, followed by a week
of re-acquainting myself with their catalog.

The show far exceeded my expectations. I'd set my expectations low because the duo don't 
generally give off a "trustworthy" vibe to me. But when I say this show _rocked_, I mean it. 
Both Ninja and Yolandi commandeered the stage seemingly with great ease, and DJ Hi-Tek did a 
phenomenal job with the music, as always.

The only part of the show where they lost me (and most of the audience) was when they brought 
their daughter out to just kind of... walk around stage for a bit, say a few words, and then 
walk off again. Not a good look, especially with the child abuse allegations they have racked up 
over the years.

Either way, it was a really fun show! Very bombastic sounds with a real _zef_ edge to it.

_Fatty Boom Boom_ — which they opened with — will be stuck in my head for the next week or so. 
And their live performances of _Ugly Boy_ and _Baby's On Fire_ were fantastic, too!
