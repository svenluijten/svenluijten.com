This show once again proves that Pusha T is one of the best rappers currently out there, and has been for the better
part of two decades. This show was an amazing display of his lyrical ability, stage presence, and _showmanship_. 

While the show had to be delayed _twice_, this was well worth the wait. I was stood all the way at the front, constantly
(aptly) looking up at Pusha performing hit after hit. I brought 3 albums for him to sign (_It's Almost Dry_, _Daytona_,
and Clipse's _Lord Willin'_), which he did! Toward the end of the show he took a while to sign some stuff for people up
front, and I was one of the lucky ones.

The most memorable moments from this show were his performances of _Let The Smokers Shine The Coupes_ (which he opened
with), _Grindin'_, _Runaway_, _Rock N Roll_, and _Diet Coke_.
