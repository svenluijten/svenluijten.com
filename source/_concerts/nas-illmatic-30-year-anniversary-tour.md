I'd already [seen Nas once](./wu-tang-clan-and-nas-ny-state-of-mind-tour.md), but that was together with the Wu-Tang
Clan. As a solo performer, he absolutely dominated the stage even more than he already did back then! The live drums
were a nice addition to the show as well.

This whole show was basically one big victory lap to celebrate the absolute chokehold his album "Illmatic" had (and
still has, in some circles) on the rap game. It will forever be remembered as one of the best projects to ever come out
of the 90s, if not the genre of hip-hop in general.

It was a fun show! He even took some time in the middle of the show to sign some of the (many) records people near the
stage were waving in front of him. Then he closed the show with some songs from the rest of his discography, emphasizing
the longevity of _him_, not just _his album_. His more recent albums together with Hit-Boy (the "King's Disease" series)
are still incredible bodies of work.
