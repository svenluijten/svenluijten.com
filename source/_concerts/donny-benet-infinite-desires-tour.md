Donny's music was new to me, but I was very pleasantly surprised when I looked it up before coming to his concert. What
an interesting mix of 80s, funk, and just pure _sex-appeal_ this guy has. A very fun evening! Donny absolutely _killed_
it on the bass, and the crowd was having the time of their lives. It was honestly one of the best crowds I've been a
part of so far.

Fun music, fun people, and overall a great night. I'm very glad I came to this show, which was coincidentally also the
final show of his _Infinite Desires_ tour.

I loved _Mr. Experience_ (the opener), _Konichiwa_, and _Santorini_.
