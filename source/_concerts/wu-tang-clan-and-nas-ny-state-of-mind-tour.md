Wu-Tang Clan _and_ Nas in _one show_?! Sign me up! Even though this was literally the day after 
[the NxWorries show I went to](./nxworries-europe-show.md), this was still a fantastic experience. The Wu-Tang Clan and
Nas traded places about 2 or 3 times to do some solo material, and all the classics you'd expect were played. 

This was another reminder that these guys absolutely run the game.

_Gravel Pit_, _NY State of Mind_, _C.R.E.A.M._, and _Ice Cream_ stand out in my mind from this show.
