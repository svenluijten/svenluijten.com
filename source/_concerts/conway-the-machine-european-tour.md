This show had a lot going for it! It was my first time in this venue (Effenaar in Eindhoven), and it was great. They even
had a little pop-up vinyl stand with 5-6 boxes of US hip-hop records to browse and potentially buy.

The grimy rap that Conway is best known for absolutely _oozed_ off the stage, with his entire crew hyping him up behind
him while he was doing his thing. I'm not super familiar with all of his music and certainly couldn't sing/rap along to
the vast majority of it, but I still had a great time vibing out!

The crowd got into it more and more as the evening progressed, with Conway treating us to his remix of Keem and Kendrick's
_Family Ties_ at the very end. I loved this show!
