I wanted to see EarthGang for a couple of years now, but wasn't left with much hope after previous visits to Europe got
called off. Until their recent "PERFECT FANTASY" album dropped, and they announced a new tour to go along with it!

The show was amazing. I was all the way up front, pushed up against the stage to see these two perform. The whole show
was a nice mix ranging from chill and laid-back songs to moshpit inducing bangers. The crowd took some time to warm up,
but in the end the energy was absolutely up there!

Once again I brought some records to get signed, and they took some time at the end of their performance (during "DEEP
BLUE") to sign stuff, so I'm now the proud owner of signed copies of Dreamville's "Revenge of the Dreamers III" and
EarthGang's "Mirrorland" albums on vinyl.

Standout songs of the evening are definitely _Run It Up_ (for which they invited a bunch of people on stage to dance!),
_Top Down_, and the Dreamville cuts _Down Bad_ and _Wells Fargo_.
