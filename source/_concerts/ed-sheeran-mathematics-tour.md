Ed Sheeran is on tour again, and Antwerp is just close enough that I decided to treat myself and my girlfriend to a little
trip there to go see him live! And wow, what a show! We moved around a fair bit during the concert to see some different
angles and give our tired and aching legs a bit of a break. Moving further away from the stage as time went by, which
turned out to be a fantastic addition to the experience!

As the light from the setting sun dimmed, the 6 massive pylons that suspended speakers, lights, and the massive 360-degree
screen in the middle stood tall and highlighted the gigantic scale of the stage. And Ed commandeered it, despite the show
being quite bare-bones (just his vocals, a guitar, and a loop pedal).

I loved the way the stage "turned around" too so that everyone could get the same experience, no matter where you stood
relative to the circular podium. The performance of Ed's massive catalogue was fantastic to experience live, and I likened
it to [Taylor Swift's Eras tour](./taylor-swift-the-eras-tour.md).

Stand-outs from the show are definitely his gut-wrenching rendition of _Eyes Closed_, the beautiful slow buildup of
_I See Fire_, and the closer of the show _Bad Habits_. He also did a little medley of some of his most popular
collaborations, which was a fun bonus! And he performed _A Little More_, which was released just 3 hours before the show!
