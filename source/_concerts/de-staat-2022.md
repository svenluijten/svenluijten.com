De Staat is a Dutch rockband with a massive catalog of classics. So when friends asked if I wanted to come, I 
_immediately_ said _yes_. I had a fantastic time seeing them perform both newer tracks that I hadn't heard before as
well as the old classics I just mentioned.

Admittedly I don't normally listen to a lot of their music, but I took a dive into their discography after this show and
loved every second of it!

Their performance of _Witchdoctor_ rocked the house, and _KITTY KITTY_ was super funky.
