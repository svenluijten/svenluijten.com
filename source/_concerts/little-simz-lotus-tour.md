Little Simz brings the energy! This is definitely up there for one of my favorite concerts I've been to this year.
Amsterdam was the last stop of her European tour, but she still had energy to spare and gave _everything_ she had for
this one.

The "Drop 7"-themed DJ set in the middle of the show was very memorable. She even did a little walk through the crowd
during one of the songs, not something a lot of other artists of her stature would do. Her (live!) band killed as well,
I was enamored by the bassist in particular.

The show ended with (of course) her hit Gorilla, and I left very satisfied and with a renewed love and appreciation for
Simz' music.
