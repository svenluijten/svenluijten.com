When you [see Kendrick once](./kendrick-lamar-damn-tour.md), you _have_ to go see him again. With his new album
_Mr. Morale And The Big Steppers_ out, a tour was bound to happen. And sure enough, a tour! I was extremely excited for
this one, and this time I got GA tickets. Less sitting, more moshing for me!

I was _all the way up front_, pushed up against the stage. The opening act (Baby Keem) was already fantastic, and then
when Kendrick took the stage, the crowd went absolutely nuts. This was a phenomenal show.

Standouts from the night were _N95_, _Rich Spirit_, and _Family Ties_ together with Baby Keem.
