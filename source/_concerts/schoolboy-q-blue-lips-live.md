I don't know how Q does it, man. He sounds so good, and commandeers the stage like he owns the place. Such a fun vibe as
well, the man truly loves performing, and that shines through in his interaction with the audience, the way he performs
his songs, and just his general _vibe_.

I do feel like the crowd was kind of mild for this show, though. There were some absolute bangers being played, and I
would've expected at least _one_ moshpit during _Yeern 101_ or something, but it never quite materialized. Oh well, I
still had a great night!

Favorites of the evening were _Blueslides_, _Man Of The Year_, and _Numb Numb Juice_.
