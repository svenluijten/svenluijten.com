When I saw they were coming over to The Netherlands, I immediately got a ticket to see the Souls of Mischief live. The 
venue wasn't fully packed, which I think was a shame! These guys are a cornerstone of the hip-hop game and deserve way 
more respect.

Either way, they put on a great show! There's still love for classic boom-bap hip-hop.

Of course the highlight was their performance of their standout single _93 'Til Infinity_.
