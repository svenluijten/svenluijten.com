After three honestly pretty decent openers (Stripe, W.O.N, and Roets), Kota took the stage and his energy immediately 
lit up the whole stage! This guy has a lot of fun doing what he does, and it definitely shows.

I'll be honest and say that I don't know the lyrics to most of his songs (there are so many!) so I couldn't answer his
call for the audience to sing along, but the little bits I do know I sang along to wholeheartedly; just like the rest of
the audience.

Kota called the couple next to me on stage to sing them one of his more lovey-dovey songs, and he closed the show by
calling about 10-15 people on stage to dance along and get the rest of the crowd moving.

At the end of the show Kota mentioned he'd be at the merch booth signing merch, so I had to go and grab me a vinyl record
to get it signed. I'm very happy with my signed copy of FOTO, and that I got a little exchange in with Kota while he
signed my record.

_Summer House_, _Hollywood_, and _SEDONA_ rocked the house, and I absolutely love that he performed his remix of Mac
Miller's _2009_.
