I have very fond memories of listening to Tycho's albums about a decade ago now (time flies!), but never got to catch
them live. They returned to their more electronic roots on their album "Infinite Health", and I was very happy I got to
see one of their sets in person.

The show was about as mesmerizing as expected, with a very wide range of people there. Some would just close their eyes
and vibe to the music, others flailed around wildly in an effort to... dance? I think?

Anywho, it was a great experience! The band even visited the merch table afterwards to sign some stuff, so you know I
just had to pick up a record to get signed.
