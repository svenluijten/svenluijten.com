My sister took my dad to see the Edwin Evers Band last year, and they came back with glowing reviews about their last
show full of 80s music. So when I saw they were doing another run with an extended setlist that included 90s hits as
well, I jumped on the opportunity to take the family out for a fun night full of classic songs!

We had a great time dancing to (and singing along with) nearly every song they played. Even though the rest of the crowd
was pretty timid, we were having the time of our lives up at the front of the stage. Belting along to Oasis' "Wonderwall"
and Rick Astley's "Never Gonna Give You Up" has never been this fun!
