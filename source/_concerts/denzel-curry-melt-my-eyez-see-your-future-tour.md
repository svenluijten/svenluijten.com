I actually skipped out on a Denzel Curry show in 2019 (that would've been my last show before COVID), and I regretted
that almost immediately. Since then, Denzel has only put out bangers, and with his new album _Melt My Eyes, See Your
Future_, I was sure I wouldn't let another opportunity like this slip.

I made sure to get to the venue fairly early on so I could claim a spot near the stage, and sure enough I was front row
together with some people I'd met in line for this incredible performance. Denzel sounds _exactly_ like he does on his 
albums live, and the energy he brings to the show is infectious.

Standout tracks he performed are _Walkin'_, _Speedboat_, and _DIET\__.
