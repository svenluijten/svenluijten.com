Porter's "SMILE! :D" album was such a bop, I couldn't help myself but go see him live again when this tour got announced.
[I'd seen him before in 2022 when he toured around with his "Nurture" album](./porter-robinson-nurture-tour.md), so I
kind of knew what to expect. However, this show exceeded my expectations by a wide margin!

Despite Porter not feeling very well, he still pushed through and delivered an amazing show for a sold out venue. The
crowd was super into it, sang along most of the songs, and was energetic from the front all the way to the back. Great
vibes all around.

Though "SMILE! :D" isn't my _favorite_ album of his, that part of the show does stand out as the most energetic to me.
The songs on there have this pop/punk vibe to them that seemed to work very well for a lot of people in the audience.
The back half of the show was filled with tracks from his earlier albums "Nurture" (my personal favorite) and "Worlds",
and closed with "Cheerleader"; the lead single from the "SMILE! :D" album.
