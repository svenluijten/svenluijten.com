This show was not quite what I expected! I'd expected some laid back R&B, but instead was treated to a barrage of
dance/house tracks that absolutely got the crowd moving. What a fun show. The minimalist choreography with Channel Tres
and his two dancers fit the vibe very well, and the crowd was super into it!

As with most concerts I go to, I followed this show up by obsessively listening to their music afterward, and it's
always so satisfying.
