This is one of my all-time favorite shows I've ever been to! When I showed up to the queue I met some people I'd seen at
other shows, so that made the waiting a lot more bearable. I snuck past the fence to put some of my stuff in a locker
before the doors even opened, but got caught pretty quickly. I hastily stuffed everything in the tiny locker and returned
to the queue.

The show itself was absolutely incredible. It was mesmerizing seeing Thundercat at work on the bass guitar; his skills
are absolutely off the charts. One of the best bass players of all time, period. And speaking of incredible musicians,
the drummer was _amazing_! The dense music and patterns of Thundercat's music are already kind of "a lot" to listen to,
but this drummer kept up without breaking a sweat. Absolute legend.

He played for a whole _two hours_, about half of which was filled with new unreleased songs (presumably) from his
upcoming album. This show only made me more hyped for it to finally come out, I can't wait anymore!

The group I was with at the front of the stage knew _every word_ to Mac Miller's _What's The Use?_, so Thundercat just
kept playing and listening to us scream all the lyrics at him. Good times, man. The audience's vibe in general was super
chill; no pushing or annoying screaming during the show. Just a bunch of people there to enjoy the entrancing 
performance.
