I was super impressed with how effortless Yasiin Bey made some of MF DOOM's songs sound. The intricate rhyme schemes and
hard-to-predict flows of the original tracks makes them very (_very_) difficult to rap along to, let alone perform live.
But I suppose that's what prompted Yasiin to say:

> Listen, I'm really good at this rap thing.

And honestly... Yeah, I agree. He nailed every verse, and some of his (unreleased) solo work he did towards the end
sounded great as well. This show was a beautiful tribute to the masked villain, and a reminder of just how great of a
rapper he was. MF DOOM: "your favorite rapper's favorite rapper."

I just wish he would have gotten on stage on time, instead of making us wait 50 minutes past the scheduled starting time.

_Meat Grinder_, _Curls_, and of course _All Caps_ were the stand-out songs for me this evening.
