I'd missed out on the official sale for these tickets, so I had to get them from a fairly shady website. This was at the
time the _one_ artist I absolutely _had_ to see live, at least one time. And with the announcement that Donald would
stop with the "Childish Gambino" moniker after these last 2 shows in London, this was my final chance. 

Luckily the tickets I'd bought were valid, and we stood there in the O2 as Childish Gambino blessed us all in so-called
"church". Some unreleased tracks that would later end up on his project _3.15.20_ were played, along with the elusive
still-unreleased track _Human Sacrifice_. A night to always remember.
