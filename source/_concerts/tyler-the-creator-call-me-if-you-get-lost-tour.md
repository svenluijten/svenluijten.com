I initially got a ticket for the _IGOR_-tour, but that had to be rescheduled twice due to COVID. In the meantime, Tyler 
released a new album and the show morphed into a hybrid _IGOR_ / _Call Me If You Get Lost_ show. Which I was not upset 
at! Both are great albums, and I'm glad I got to see Tyler live.

I would have liked to have been closer to the stage, there was an entire area reserved for "Golden Circle" ticket
holders that forced me (and the rest of the plebs) to stay at about 30m distance. Luckily I still had a decent view of
the stage though!

The fireworks during _CORSO_, pyrotechnics during _Who Dat Boy_, and moshpits during _NEW MAGIC WAND_ made this a very
memorable show, I thoroughly enjoyed myself. Worth the 4-hour queue!
