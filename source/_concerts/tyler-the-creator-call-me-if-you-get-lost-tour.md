I initially got a ticket for the _IGOR_-tour, but that had to be rescheduled twice due to COVID. In the meantime, Tyler 
released a new album, and the show became sort of a hybrid _IGOR_ / _Call Me If You Get Lost_ show. Which I was not
upset at! Both are great albums, and I'm glad I got to see Tyler live. 

The fireworks during _CORSO_, pyrotechnics during _Who Dat Boy_, and moshpits during _NEW MAGIC WAND_ were awesome. What 
a show!
