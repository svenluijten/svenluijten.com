GET TOP ON THE PHOOOOOONNNNNEEEE üó£Ô∏èüó£Ô∏èüó£Ô∏è

Doechii is a powerhouse. This was an incredible show with very little room for improvement. It was my first time in this
(tiny!) venue, and she absolutely rocked the place. If you don't know the name, you better learn it, because I have a
feeling we'll be seeing a lot more from Doechii in the coming years.

Banger after banger after banger. Some introspective songs thrown in there as well to balance it out, but this was one
hell of a concert. Doechii's versatility was on full display here, and I can only say positive things about her. The
crowd was vibing, too.

My favorite songs from the evening were Persuasive and WAIT, but everything was incredible.
