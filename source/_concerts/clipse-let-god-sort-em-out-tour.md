This show opened with _jev._, who a couple of people standing next to me in the venue already knew. I think I've heard a
couple of his songs before, but never really paid attention to him or his music. After his set, I'm a fan! Definitely on
the list of artists to check out.

Clipse entered the stage with their song _Chains and Whips_; first Pusha T during his verse, and then he was joined by
his brother Malice when it was time for his verse on the song. What a performance! The two just exude confidence and
(for lack of a better term) "swag".

The show was a mix of their most recent _Let God Sort Em Out_ album and tracks from their back-catalogue. At the end of
their (short but _very_ punchy) set, they took some time to sign stuff for people in the crowd. Pusha T already signed
my copy of _Lord Willin'_ [when I saw him in 2023](./pusha-t-its-almost-dry-tour.md), but I managed to get Malice's
autograph on it, as well as both on my copy of _Let God Sort Em Out_. I'm hyped!

I thoroughly enjoyed (and may have shed a tear to) the live performance of _Birds Don't Sing_, rocked out to _Grindin'_,
and the opener _Whips and Chains_ was just an incredible vibe all around!
