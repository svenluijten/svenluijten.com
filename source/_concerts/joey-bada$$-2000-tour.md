Apparently this show sold out _so quick_ that the organizers wanted to add another date, but that wouldn't fit into
Joey's busy touring schedule. So instead of a new date, they just planned _two shows on the same night_. I got myself a
ticket for the first show, and Joey was incredible live. The energy this guy brought (which I hope he saved some of for
the second show) was infectious, and the crowd followed his example.

_DEVASTATED_, _TEMPTATION_, and _Survival Tactics_ stand out from the night, though everything he performed sounded
sublime.
