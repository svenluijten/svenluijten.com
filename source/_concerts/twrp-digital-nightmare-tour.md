TWRP put the "fun" in "funky"! I honestly didn't know quite what to expect because someone asked me to join them to this
show. I had heard of the band in passing, but never really dug into their discography (or other parts of their large
catalog of content). That's all to say that this show exceeded my expectations!

The overarching storyline they created was playful and fun, but did come off as childish at times to me. That didn't
detract much from the excellent music though. The bass player and drummer absolutely killed it, and some of those bass
lines are still stuck in my head.
