Jordan Ward is an absolute menace on stage. He gives off such infectious crazy energy, you can't help but to dance along!
His voice is also _amazing_ live, which I didn't expect. Not sure why, because he hits even the most difficult notes with
ease.

The show was a lot of fun; the crowd was super into it and I had a great time singing along to most of his songs. The
highlights from this evening for me were _DANCE MACHINE_, _Okok (Hibachi)_, and of course his mega-hit _FAMJAM4000_.
