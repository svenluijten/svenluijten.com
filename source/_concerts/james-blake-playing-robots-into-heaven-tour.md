I saw James open for Kendrick Lamar [back in 2018](./kendrick-lamar-damn-tour.md), but now that he had a new album out I
had to go see one of his own shows in a smaller, more intimate venue.

On his latest album, "Playing Robots Into Heaven", James Blake returns to his more experimental EDM side. And I quite
like it! The accompanying live show he put on for us on his birthday (yes, the audience sang him "Happy Birthday" when
he came out) is just as captivating as the album itself. Lights flashing from all sides, a frame surrounding the stage
as if watching a movie. Fantastic set design.

The infinitely dance-able song _Loading_, beautifully quiet _There's A Limit To Your Love_, trance-inducing _Fall Back_,
and his mega-hit _Retrograde_ were all amazing in their own right to experience from up close.
