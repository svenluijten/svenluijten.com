Bas is the second Dreamville artist I've seen live ([JID being the first](./jid-forever-story-tour.md)), and I can say
for certain now that they don't miss. His latest album "We Only Talk About Real Shit When We're Fucked Up" is a
fantastic listen front-to-back, and I couldn't be happier he came to Amsterdam to let us enjoy it live.

I also brought 2 records for him to sign, which he  did! Very happy I made it to this show, can't wait to have him back
for more!

Standouts from this evening were _Light Of My Soul_ (the opener), _179 Deli_, the new song he debuted together with The
Hics, the opening act, and some of his Dreamville cuts like _Down Bad_ and _Costa Rica_.
