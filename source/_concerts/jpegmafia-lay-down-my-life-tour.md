I think I have whiplash after seeing JPEGMAFIA's energy switch from "so anyway, here's the next song" to him frantically
jumping around on stage and screaming the lyrics at the top of his lungs in about half a second. This show was a deluge
of weird but intricate beats, out-there bars, insane lighting effects and smoke, and the audience going absolutely crazy
in the mosh pits. All-in-all, a fun way to spend a Monday evening.

Among the setlist was an unreleased song, which he'd seemingly been building on during the tour he's on now. I'd heard
snippets before, but this version he played live was entirely different, more "full", and had extra lyrics that weren't
in the previous versions I heard. Fun to see a song slowly come together like that.

He didn't do a whole lot of talking or audience interaction during the show, but did take some time after it wrapped up
to sign some merch for fans at the front.

Show highlights for me were his song _BALD!_, _Steppa Pig_, _either on or off the drugs_, and _of course_ his cover of
Carly Rae Jepsen's _Call Me Maybe_.
