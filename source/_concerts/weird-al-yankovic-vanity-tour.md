"Weird Al" Yankovic is one of those artists that just have this spot in my mind as being "legends" for any given genre.
And while (as the tour name might suggest) he didn't play very many of his _big hits_, it was mostly an intimite showing
of his talent as a songwriter, accordion player, and overall performer.

He did treat us to a little medley of all the hits at the end of the show though, so that was nice.
