This was a super fun show! Ever since their Tiny Desk concert Tank and the Bangas' eclectic mix of soul, funk, spoken
word, and hip-hop have been on my radar. The live orchestra really added to the whole experience, too.

_Boxes and Squares_ was super fun live, and _Quick_ stands out as the "banger" from this evening. The drummer got to
show off his raw skills during _Oak Tree_, which I was super impressed by! Of course, _Rollercoasters_ was the cherry on
top as the closer.
