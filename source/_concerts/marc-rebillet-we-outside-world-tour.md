Marc Rebillet has _so much freaking energy_. His YouTube videos pale in comparison to seeing him improvise banger after
banger live with just a DAW and a loopdeck. The show started off with him walking on stage in his underwear (and _only_
his underwear), getting the crowd hyped up, shooting a load of confetti into the crowd (and on the lighting installation),
and making entrancing and head-bopping beats as if they were nothing.

The crowd was feeling this show as well; there's very few crowds I've been in that were as chill as this one. Everyone
was vibing, and the moshpits were some of the most fun I've had in a very long time.

Please come back soon, Loop Daddy. I need more of these kinds of shows in my life.
