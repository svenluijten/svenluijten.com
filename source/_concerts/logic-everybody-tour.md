I'm writing this in 2023, and honestly I don't remember a lot from this show besides the fact that Logic sounds _great_
live and that he called Justin Roiland (co-creator of Rick & Morty) live on stage. Though I'm pretty sure that part of
the show was scripted.

Standout songs from the show were _America_ and _Gang Related_.
