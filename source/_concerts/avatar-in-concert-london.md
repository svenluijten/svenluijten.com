Avatar: The Last Airbender is my favorite TV show, so when [Avatar in Concert](https://www.avatarinconcert.com) was
announced I _pounced_ on the idea and decided to fly over to London just to experience its music performed by a live
orchestra. A decision I'm very happy with, it was _so_ worth it!

I'd never been to a live orchestra performance before this, so I wasn't sure exactly what to expect. But this
overwhelmingly exceeded my expectations. We had some fantastic seats to see and hear everything perfectly. In fact,
Bryan Konietzko, the co-creator of Avatar, was in the row behind us watching the show as well! I got a selfie and got to
shake his hand after it wrapped up, which I'm over the moon with.

The show itself was fantastic as well, with amazing music composed by Jeremy Zuckerman and his team and the accompanying
scenes from the show projected on a large screen above the orchestra. Laughs were had, tears were shed
("leaves from the vine", anyone?).

I'm also very glad that I got tickets to their Rotterdam show so I can experience this masterpiece one more time. After
this, we'll have to wait for books 2 and 3 to be released on vinyl and streaming services.
