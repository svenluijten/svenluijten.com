As a present for my dad, I took him with me to see Genesis (and thereby Phil Collins) perform. This ended up being one
of the last shows they _ever_ did. It was a fun time, and I felt good bringing the average age in the audience down by
at least a decade.

It wasn't nearly as energetic of a show as [Childish Gambino](./childish-gambino-this-is-america-tour.md) or 
[Kendrick Lamar](./kendrick-lamar-damn-tour.md), but it certainly didn't have to be. They played some of their
discography that I'm not intimitely familiar with, but it was still a fun time to spend with my dad!

Of course _Land of Confusion_ and _I Can't Dance_ whipped up the energy at the end of the show, and Phil's son killed it 
on the drums throughout the show!
