This was a little family trip; my parents, sister, her boyfriend, and I all went to go and see the (twice rescheduled)
show with Queen and Adam Lambert. What an amazing display of ability, and a great ode to the legendary music from a band
that positively changed the world of music.

The visuals of this show were also spectacular, with Brian May even shooting fireworks out of his guitar at one point
during _A Kind Of Magic_!
