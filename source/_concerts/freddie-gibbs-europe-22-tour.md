Man, Freddie is a beast. Such a fun presence to see perform, and his lyricism is always on point. He totally rocked the
house with his expansive catalog of music. Some old, some new, and you could tell he was just there to have fun.

I'll never forget when he did his part of [_Something to Rap About_](https://youtu.be/POw27Wug4wo), and then called upon
the audience to do the Tyler, The Creator part. Which fell apart after just one or two sentences, so we got rightfully
made fun of for the fact that we were just mumbling along. Fun times!
