My first show ever, and it was a good one! Started off with Samm Henshaw and Jay Prince as openers; Samm Henshaw's act
definitely piqued my interest and I will be diving into his music discrography afterwards! As soon as Chance took the 
stage, someone threw his beer towards him. This prompted a re-do of the intro, but thankfully the rest of the show went 
off without a hitch, and we all had a great night.

I was nervous as this was my first ever live show (and I went alone!), but that all faded very quickly. Everyone there
is a stranger, but you _at least_ have one thing in common, and that is your love and appreciation for the artist you're
there to see.

Standouts from that evening were _Angels_ (which he opened with), _Ultralight Beam_, and _Same Drugs_, which most of the
crowd sang along to. [He was so taken aback by it!](https://youtu.be/3QKIlTwZDPo).
