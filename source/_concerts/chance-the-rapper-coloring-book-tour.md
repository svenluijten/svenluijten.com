My first show ever, and it was a doozy! Started off with Samm Henshaw and Jay Prince as openers; Samm Henshaw's act
definitely piqued my interest! As soon as Chance took the stage, someone threw his beer towards him. This prompted a
re-do of the intro, but thankfully the rest of the show went off without a hitch.

Standouts from that evening were _Angels_ (which he opened with) and _Ultralight Beam_.
