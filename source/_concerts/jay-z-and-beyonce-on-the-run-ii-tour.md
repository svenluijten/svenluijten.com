This was insane to get tickets for. I was _super_ excited for this show, both of these artists are legendary in their
own right, and seeing them together was like a dream come true. 

They dropped the single _Apeshit_ off of _The Carters_ just the week before this show, but unfortunately they didn't
perform it live. Jay Z and Beyoncé traded every couple songs to keep it fresh and keep the crowd happy, and it ended up
being a pretty entertaining show.

Standouts from the evening were (of course) _Crazy In Love_, _Ni\*\*as In Paris_, and _Single Ladies_. All classics,
executed to perfection.
