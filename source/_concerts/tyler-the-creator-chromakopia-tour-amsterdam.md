After [Tyler's show in Antwerp about 2 weeks ago](./tyler-the-creator-chromakopia-tour-antwerp.md), I had high hopes for
this one in Amsterdam (his first of two sold out shows here), and he delivered! Another super fun show with great banter,
a vibing and respectful crowd, fun mosh pits, and an artist that gave it all.

I was disappointed he didn't do _Balloon_ this time, which he _did_ perform in Antwerp. _Like Him_ was phenomenal, and
you could tell Tyler had a lot of fun going through his back-catalogue of music live with the crowd with tracks like
_She_, _IFHY_, and the more recent _See You Again_.
