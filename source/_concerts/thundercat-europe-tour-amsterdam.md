Yes I've [seen Thundercat once](./thundercat-europe-tour-utrecht.md), but what about _second_ Thundercat? I mean, who
wouldn't want to experience this show again? It was, again, phenomenal. An onslaught of excellent music, and the 
audience's good vibes from yesterday extended to today.

I'd brought some records for him to sign yesterday, but he didn't sign them then. So I figured, why not try again today?
And sure enough; at the end of his set (after the encore and everything), he waved at me to hand him the record and a
marker and I got it signed!

Thrilled to have seen Thundercat (again), and to have his autograph on my copy of _It Is What It Is_!
