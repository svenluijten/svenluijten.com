While not the kind of music I'll typically listen to, this was a ridiculously fun show! Every time I do listen to some
of Black Pumas' music the first thing that I notice is the incredible range of the frontman Eric Burton. It seems like
his vocals could reach to the moon and back, and the live performance matches that picture.

The crowd was very... "respectful". That is to say they were a lot more tame compared to
[the show I was at yesterday](./nas-illmatic-30-year-anniversary-tour.md), hah. Either way, the energy was up there, and
we had a great time!

They closed the show with their super-hit "Colors", and the encore was Eric doing an acoustic rendition of Tracy
Chapman's "Fast Car". A very nice surprise!
