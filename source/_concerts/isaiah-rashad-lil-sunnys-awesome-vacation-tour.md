This show was unfortunately riddled with technical issues. The sound in Paradiso isn't known for being great, but when
audio equipment also starts malfunctioning during the show _and_ the performer has a sore throat, it doesn't make for
a great show.

Isaiah persisted through all that though and put on a show as best he could, and I still had a great night! The moshing
at the end of the show to other TDE-tracks was memorable!
