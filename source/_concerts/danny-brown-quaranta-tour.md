Man the crowd was _feeling_ this show! First the opener (Keenan Mundane) pleasantly
surprised everyone with his performance. You could really hear the Danny Brown
influence, but he still gave his music his own twist to make it not sound like a
cheap knock-off. And he made all the beats himself! It was just him with a little
DJ panel and a mic.

Not even 15 minutes into Danny Brown’s set, I was drenched in my own and other
people’s sweat. Moshing can be fun at times, but this was a bit much for me. I
was (perhaps unfairly) surprised at how good Danny sounded live. His voice had a
massive range in- and outside the studio.

I jumped and moshed to the side of the stage to watch the rest of the performance
in a bit more peace, and after enjoying Danny’s set of about an hour, I managed to
make it out of the venue nice and early.

My favorites from this show were _Dip_, _Orange Juice Jones_, his verse on
_Really Doe_ (plus the audience call-and-response for the chorus), and
_Side B (Dope Song)_ as part of the encore.
