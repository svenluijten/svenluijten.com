I'm unsure how CunninLynguists found their way onto my radar (a _long_ time ago!) but I'm very happy they did. Their
classic boom-bap hip-hop sound is unmistakably "southern" and they smoothly flow over their beats. Mixed with funny,
introspective, and clever wordplay (they didn't name themselves "cunning linguists" for nothing), the three members
manage to deliver an incredible show, even well over 2 decades into their career.

The concert was all-around good vibes, too. Hyped up when it needed to be, but there was plenty of time to breathe in
between. Each of the members got a solo song towards the end of the show, and they closed out with some of their biggest
hits from "Will Rap For Food".

The ethereal beat to "Lynguistics" will be stuck in my mind for a good while after this show.
