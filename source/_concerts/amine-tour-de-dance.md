Aminé touring for an album called "13 Months of Sunshine" in the middle of December? Yes, please! I needed me some 
musical sunshine to counteract the seasonal depression, and Aminé delivered!

This show really felt like summer in a bottle, with Aminé commandeering the stage and keeping the audience in a chokehold 
with his hard-hitting and super fast paced beats and rhymes. Every era from his discography made an appearance, with songs 
from the hip-hop focussed *Good for You*, *OnePointFive* and *Limbo* to the dance joints *13 Months of Sunshine* and his
collaboration with Kaytranada *KAYTRAMINÉ*.

He had a handheld camera that streamed the live view to the giant LED screen at the back of the stage, which was a very
fun touch to include the audience in parts of the show. Of course, he also brought his tour pants for someone in the crowd
to sign. That pair of pants has been all over the world, it's a really fun tradition to keep up.

I really liked his performance of *REDMERCEDES*, *Charmander*, and *Arc de Triomphe*.
