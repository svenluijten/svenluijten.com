During one of the opening acts for this show, the crowd was kind of bored and looking for something to do. Eventually,
they discovered they could crowdsurf people all the way to the back of the venue. That was very fun to watch from the
balcony while a mediocre Belgian rapper was doing his thing on stage.

Anyway. Even though his most recent project didn't grab me as much as his previous albums, Denzel Curry is still well
worth seeing live. His energy is super infectious and he can get a crowd moving like very few other artists can. As you
can imagine he played some of his biggest hits in a very chaotic and "all over the place" show.

He only performed for a little over an hour, which was a bit of a disappointment because of the enormous catalogue of
music he has to make a show out of, but this once again solidifies Denzel's ethos of "quality over quantity".

All-in-all, a very fun show, and I'm glad I got to see him perform live again after 
[already seeing him once 3 years ago](./denzel-curry-melt-my-eyez-see-your-future-tour.md).

_Diet\__ (to the beat of Kendrick Lamar's _tv off_) and _Sumo_ are definite standout tracks from this evening.
