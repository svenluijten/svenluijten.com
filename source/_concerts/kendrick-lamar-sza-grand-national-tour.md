I say this every show, but man... This was incredible. The queue was long (about 4 hours of queueing, plus an additional
2 hours of waiting inside the venue before the _opening act_ even started), but it was _so_ worth it! We stood directly
against the barrier, just 3m away from the stage where Kendrick and SZA would perform.

DJ Mustard was the opening act; a fun set to get the crowd moving and ready for the stars of the evening. He played some
hits he produced, with some other fun songs mixed in to get us warmed up.

And then the main act. Kendrick opened up the show with _wacced out murals_ while he and his GNX emerged from below the
stage, and he started his set. Later SZA joined for _Doves In The Wind_ after which Kendrick passed the baton off to her
for a couple of songs. This was a very fun way to keep the crowd engaged and entertained; they kept switching it up.

This went on for about 3 hours between the two, and I enjoyed all 240 minutes of it. Absolute banger of a show, even
after having seen Kendrick [on the DAMN tour](./kendrick-lamar-damn-tour.md) and [the Mr. Morale and the Big Steppers tour](./kendrick-lamar-mr-morale-and-the-big-steppers-tour.md)
previously. He keeps it fresh and leaves me wanting more! Already can't wait for my fourth Kendrick show in a couple of
years (hopefully! üôè)

Picking a favorite from this show is impossible. It was simply phenomenal.
