I found Laila when this show was announced, listened to her recent album "Gap Year" once or twice, and immediately knew
I wanted to go! She sounds as amazing live as she does on the recorded version, and I'm super happy to have been able to
see her in such an intimate venue. If I were to estimate, there were only about 200-250 people at the venue, but she
killed it as if there were 1000s!

Laila even sprinkled in some little DJ-set parts as well, of her cooking up a beat on the spot and then seamlessly
transitioning it to one of her songs. Some unreleased songs, a guest appearance from her mother, and an unexpected
encore later, we all left this show wanting more.

_If You Don't Know By Now_, _SINK 2 RISE_, and _Not My Problem_ were some of my favorites of the evening.
