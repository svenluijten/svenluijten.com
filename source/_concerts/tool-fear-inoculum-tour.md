I don't listen to TOOL in my daily life, but I knew of their existence and legendary status in the metal genre. The
visuals at this show were absolutely mind-blowing, and the music was incredible. Even though midway the guitarist had to
switch guitar for one of the songs because he'd apparently been handed the wrong one.
