We arrived just as Mike DEAN (the first opener) was working towards the end of his set, during which we found a spot to
chill out near the front of the stage. The second opener was Kaytranada, whom I listen to quite a bit as it is, so when
I saw he was one of the openers for The Weeknd today I got extra excited! His set was dope with a lot of his classics,
unreleased exclusives, and his newest stuff with Amin√© thrown in.

30 minutes before The Weeknd was scheduled to take the stage, the lights dimmed and the music started, which was a nice
surprise. Immediately noticable is how Abel gave his all during this performance; the way this man commanded the stage
was absolutely incredible. Standouts for me were him performing _Hurricane_ (+ accompanying pyrotechnics), _Less Than
Zero_, and _Blinding Lights_
