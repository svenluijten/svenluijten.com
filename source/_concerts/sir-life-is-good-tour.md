I arrived halfway through the opening act, and the crowd was already buzzing. A pretty good DJ set from Jazmine Nikitta
later, and we were left waiting for SiR, who took the stage a few minutes before 9pm; right on time!

Man this guy has a _fantastic_ voice! I was amazed by his ability to perform all of his songs pretty much perfectly as
they are on streaming services. SiR has an incredible stage presence as well, the guy owns that stage when he's up there.

He interacted with the crowd quite a bit and even called a young fan (a 7- or 8-year-old kid from the audience) on stage
to dance to his song _Poetry in Motion_. The kid killed it and of course the crowd was super into it!

My favorites of this night were SiR's performances of _SIX WHOLE DAYS_, _Poetry in Motion_, and _TRYIN' MY HARDEST_.
