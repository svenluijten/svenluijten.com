Initially Deadmau5 was supposed to bring his "Cube" tour to Europe, but thanks to logistical issues, unfortunately
"The Cube" couldn't make it here in time for the show. Nevertheless, he put on a great show with amazingly absurd 
visuals and some awesome live DJ-ing. 

We (the crowd) even managed to crowdsurf one dude from all the way in the front to the back of the venue upon his
request. Challenge succeeded!
