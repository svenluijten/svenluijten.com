Wow, this was a phenomenal show! [I'd seen Tyler before, back in 2022](./tyler-the-creator-call-me-if-you-get-lost-tour.md),
but this show surpassed even that, in my opinion. The set design, the storytelling in the show, and of course the
incredible music from his back catalogue, ... Everything was top-notch!

The openers where Paris Texas and Lil Yachty; 2 artists I must say I'm not super familiar with. But Paris Texas definitely
surprised me with their sound; I'll be looking into them more!

Tyler opened his set with the first couple songs off of his most recent album, CHROMAKOPIA. And _man_, those first few
songs hit even harder live than they do when listening to the album on streaming. The mosh pits during _Rah Tah Tah_ were
absolutely insane where I was, and I'm not the type to stand on the sidelines and watch ðŸ˜‰

The show moved to the center stage during _Sticky_, where he ended up doing a bunch of stuff off older albums, ushered in
by him putting the corresponding vinyl record on a turntable. He moved back to the "main" stage after a fair few songs,
and then closed out the show with a few more bangers from all different eras of his music.

Definitely a night to remember, and this is a new contender for "the best show I've been to"; though it's hard to pick
from all of them.
