    <h1 class="sr-only">Now</h1>

    I'm currently working as a full time PHP developer at [Online Payment Platform](https://onlinepaymentplatform.com), making the world of online payments
    easier every day. On the side I'm working on tweaking this website and maintaining [my open source packages](https://github.com/svenluijten?tab=repositories). I
    don't have any major code-projects planned for now.

    Health-wise I'm doing great. Going to the gym to lift 4 times a week (I'm doing a push-pull-legs split). My goal for
    this year is to at least bench press 70kg, squat 80kg, and deadlift 100kg. I think that's attainable for me, if I work
    at it hard enough.

    One of my goals for the first half of 2024 is to buy my own place. I still live with my parents at the moment, it's been
    time to move out. Hopefully I'll find something relatively quickly.
