After seeing this on [Chris Coyier's blog](https://chriscoyier.net/2023/11/25/default-apps-2023/) and subsequently listening to [episode 097 of "Hemispheric Views"](https://listen.hemisphericviews.com/097) I figured I'd chime in.

Some bonus apps I use that don't fit into the above categories:

- [Raycast](https://www.raycast.com) as a launcher, snippet repository, and clipboard manager.
- [Rectangle](https://rectangleapp.com) for window management.
- [Smooze](https://smooze.co) to make scrolling on macOS not annoying.
- [Toggl Track](https://toggl.com/track/) for time tracking.
- [Endel](https://endel.io) to help me stay focussed during long stretches of work.
- Apple's `Health.app` and `Fitness.app` in combination with my Apple Watch to keep me healthy and somewhat sane.

[Robb](https://rknight.me) has created [a massive list of links to other people's default apps](https://defaults.rknight.me), if you want to go see their setups. I might do one every year; would be interesting to see how this list evolves over time.
