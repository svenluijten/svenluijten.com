## Work
I'm currently working as a full time PHP developer at [Online Payment Platform](https://onlinepaymentplatform.com), making
the world of online payments easier every day. On the side I'm continuously tweaking this website and maintaining
[my open source packages](https://github.com/svenluijten?tab=repositories). I don't have any major code-projects planned
for now.

## Health
- I've been lifting 4 times a week consistently for about a year now. I hope to keep that habit alive.
- A 2024 goal of mine is to get all my big lifts (bench, squat, deadlift) up to at least 100kg each.
- I've sort of been slacking on the cardio front lately, so I'm working on that by taking long(er) walks.

## Life
- Buying an apartment (!)
- Spending time with the people I love.
