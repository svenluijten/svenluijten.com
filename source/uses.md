## Hardware
I'm all-in on the Apple ecosystem, as will soon become clear on this page. My daily driver phone is the
_iPhone 15 Pro Max_ in a _Peak Design Everyday Case with Loop (Midnight)_, and
on my wrist is an _Apple Watch Series 6_.

My default headphones when out and about are the _AirPods Pro_ (2nd generation, USB-C), but
I'll reach for my _Sony WH1000 XM3's_ if I need better noise-cancelling. My home setup has a
pair of beaten-down _Audio Technica ATH M50x's_, and they're still great after all these years!
Together with my _Blue Snowball_ microphone they make a decent audio setup for a small home
office.

Speaking of home office; the headphones and microphone are hooked up to a _CalDigit TS3+_ dock
which connects them back to my laptop, a _MacBook Pro 2019_ with an i7 processor and 32 GB of
RAM. This is hooked up (again, via the CalDigit dock) to 2 _Dell UltraSharp U2515H_ monitors.

The peripherals on and around my desk are the _Logitech C920_ webcam, a
_Logitech MX Master 3 for Mac_ mouse, and the _Keychron K8 Pro_ keyboard.
Clickety-clack.

## Home audio
I have an _Audio Technica AT-LP120XUSB_ turntable going into a _Denon PMA-600NE_
amplifier. This powers my 2 _Jamo S803_ bookshelf speakers for listening to my vinyl record
collection.

## Photography
The main camera I shoot with is my _Sony A7iv_, paired with the _Sony 24-70mm f/2.8 GM II_
and _Sony 20mm f/1.8 G_ lenses. I have a _Sony A6300_ as a secondary camera,
for which I have the _Sony 18-105mm f/4 G_, _Sony 55-210mm f/4.5-6.3_, and
_Sigma 30mm f/1.4 DC DN_.

I have several accessories from Peak Design for my camera, namely the _Cuff_, _Slide Lite_,
_Slide_, and of course the _Capture_, together with about a dozen anchor links
strewn around the place. Their _aluminium Travel Tripod_ also gets some occasional use.

## Software
My main IDE is _PhpStorm_, but I'm eager to learn more about _vim_. My terminal
is _iTerm_ in the _zsh_ shell with _oh-my-zsh_ installed.
_Raycast_ is probably my most-used app out of anything on this page. I use it as a launcher,
snippet manager, clipboard history, and more.

My browser of choice is _Safari_, and I tend to stick close to the
<a href="/posts/default-apps-2023" class="link">defaults</a>. I suck at remembering things, so I offload a
lot of that work to _Things_ for to-do's and _Obsidian_ for my other writing
and longer or more complex projects.

## Travel
My daily carry is a _20L Peak Design Everyday Backpack_, the "Tan" colored version 1. This is
fine for my daily commute and other small trips, but I also have a
_30L Peak Design Everyday Backpack_ ("Charcoal", also v1) for weekend trips or when I just
need more space.

My _Peak Design Travel Backpack_ (black) serves me well on longer trips, and it will be filled
mostly with Peak Design accessories; namely the _Tech Pouch_, _Wash Pouch_,
_Field Pouch_, _Camera Cube_, and _Packing Cubes_.
