# I use... {#nolink}

This page details all the hard- and software I use on a day-to-day basis. Be sure to also take a look
at [uses.tech](https://uses.tech) for a list of other awesome `/uses` pages!

## Workplace

My daily driver at the moment is a 2019 MacBook Pro with an Intel Core i7 processor, 32 GB of RAM, and a 512 GB SSD.
This is attached to my CalDigit TS3+ via a single Thunderbolt 3 cable, which is hooked up to 2 Dell Ultrasharp U2515H
displays.

My peripherals of choice are:

- The Logitech MX Master 3 for Mac mouse.
- [Keychron K8 Pro (Aluminium + RGB with Gateron G Pro Mechanical Red switches)](https://www.keychron.com/products/keychron-k8-pro-qmk-via-wireless-mechanical-keyboard?variant=40024462327897).
- A pair of AudioTechnica M50x headphones.
- Blue Snowball microphone.
- Logitech C920 for my webcam-needs.

I will also occasionally use my pair of AirPods Pro (2019) if I am feeling adventurous.

I have the [IKEA IDÃ…SEN sit/standing desk](https://www.ikea.com/us/en/p/idasen-desk-sit-stand-black-dark-gray-s79280998/), 
and when I am not standing at it, I sit on a [Herman Miller Aeron desk chair](https://store.hermanmiller.com/gaming-chairs/aeron-gaming-chair/2521927.html).
