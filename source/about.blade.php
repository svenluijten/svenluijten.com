            <p class="mb-4">
                and I am a full stack developer for the web. I got my start in the <a href="https://laravel.com">Laravel
                    framework</a>,
                which I am still a big fan of to this day! I often <a href="https://github.com/svenluijten">contribute
                    to open source projects and packages</a>
                and also <a href="https://github.com/svenluijten?tab=repositories">maintain several of my own</a>.
            </p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p class="mb-4">
        My aim is to write elegant, easy-to-follow, and maintainable code, always using the best tool for the job.
        So far, I have had the privilege of working with a lot of tools and technologies, including:
    </p>

    <blockquote class="border-l-4 border-gray-300 pl-3 mb-4">
        PHP, Java, Golang, Javascript, Laravel, Docker, Git, MySQL, TailwindCSS, Vue.js, React, Kubernetes,
        Spring Boot, GitHub, GitLab, Jira, PhpStorm, REST APIs, OpenAPI, Postman, StoplightIO, ...
    </blockquote>
