                and I am a full stack developer for the web, a photographer, and lifter of heavy things. From an early
                age, I became interested in everything to do with computers. To dismay of my parents, I hacked away at
                the family computer, took apart video players to try and figure out how they worked, and wrote small
                scripts to impress my classmates.

    <p class="mb-4">
        This led to me eventually going to school to write code, which is where I got introduced to PHP and
        eventually the <a href="https://laravel.com">Laravel framework</a>, which I am still a big fan of to
        this day! I often <a href="https://github.com/svenluijten">contribute to open source projects and
            packages</a> and also <a href="https://github.com/svenluijten?tab=repositories">maintain several of
            my own</a>.
    </p>

    <p class="mb-4">
        I am nearly always capturing what's around me with either my phone or my camera, both for pleasure and in a
        professional capacity. You can view some of my work on <a href="https://instagram.com/luijten.photography">
            Instagram</a> or read about the shoots I do on <a href="https://luijten.photography">my (Dutch)
            photography blog</a>.
    </p>

    <p class="mb-4">
        I also keep <a href="{{ $page->link('concerts') }}">a concert log</a> and do some
        <a href="{{ $page->link('writing') }}">general writing</a> on this site.
